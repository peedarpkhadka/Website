            <h2>The Timeless Craft of Poetry</h2>
            <p>
                Poetry distills the essence of human experience into rhythmic, evocative language. 
                From the structured sonnets of Shakespeare to the unbound verses of Walt Whitman, 
                blends imagery, sound, and emotion to create lasting impact. It explores themes of love, 
                loss, nature, and identity, resonating across cultures and eras. 
                Poets like Sylvia Plath and Pablo Neruda use metaphor and rhythm to transform the mundane into 
                the profound, inviting readers to uncover layered meanings.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Study Poetry?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sharpens linguistic precision through concise expression.</li>
                <li>Cultivates empathy by connecting readers to universal emotions.</li>
                <li>Enhances critical thinking via analysis of form, meter, and symbolism.</li>
                <li>Inspires creativity through experimentation with language and structure.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Forms to Explore</h3>
            <p>Haikus capture fleeting moments in 5-7-5 syllables; villanelles, like Dylan Thomas’s <em>Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night</em>, repeat lines for emotional depth; free verse offers limitless freedom.</p>

                <h4>CRAZY</h4>
                <p><strong>1.</strong><br>
                Oh yes, friend! I'm crazy-<br>
                that's just the way I am.</p>

                <p><strong>2.</strong><br>
                I see sounds,<br>
                I hear sights,<br>
                I taste smells,<br>
                I touch not heaven but things from the underworld,<br>
                things people do not believe exist,<br>
                whose shapes the world does not suspect.<br>
                Stones I see as flowers<br>
                lying water-smoothed by the water's edge,<br>
                rocks of tender forms<br>
                in the moonlight<br>
                when the heavenly sorceress smiles at me,<br>
                putting out leaves, softening, glistening,<br>
                throbbing, they rise up like mute maniacs,<br>
                like flowers, a kind of moon-bird's flowers.<br>
                I talk to them the way they talk to me,<br>
                a language, friend,<br>
                that can't be written or printed or spoken,<br>
                can't be understood, can't be heard.<br>
                Their language comes in ripples to the moonlit Ganges banks,<br>
                ripple by ripple-<br>
                oh yes, friend! I'm crazy-<br>
                that's just the way I am.</p>

                <p><strong>3.</strong><br>
                You're clever, quick with words,<br>
                your exact equations are right forever and ever.<br>
                But in my arithmetic, take one from one-<br>
                and there's still one left.<br>
                You get along with five senses,<br>
                I with a sixth.<br>
                You have a brain, friend,<br>
                I have a heart.<br>
                A rose is just a rose to you-<br>
                to me it's Helen and Padmini.<br>
                You are forceful prose<br>
                I liquid verse.<br>
                When you freeze I melt,<br>
                When you're clear I get muddled<br>
                and then it works the other way around.<br>
                Your world is solid,<br>
                mine vapor,<br>
                yours coarse, mine subtle.<br>
                You think a stone reality;<br>
                harsh cruelty is real for you.<br>
                I try to catch a dream,<br>
                the way you grasp the rounded truth of cold, sweet coin.<br>
                I have the sharpness of the thorn,<br>
                you of gold and diamonds.<br>
                You think the hills are mute-<br>
                I call them eloquent.<br>
                Oh yes, friend!<br>
                I'm free in my inebriation-<br>
                that's just the way I am.</p>

                <p><strong>4.</strong><br>
                In the cold of the month of Magh<br>
                I sat<br>
                warming to the first white heat of the star.<br>
                the world called me drifty.<br>
                When they saw me staring blankly for seven days<br>
                after I came back from the burning ghats<br>
                they said I was a spook.<br>
                When I saw the first marks of the snows of time<br>
                in a beautiful woman's hair<br>
                I wept for three days.<br>
                When the Buddha touched my soul<br>
                they said I was raving.<br>
                They called me a lunatic because I danced<br>
                when I heard the first spring cuckoo.<br>
                One dead-quite moon night<br>
                breathless I leapt to my feet,<br>
                filled with the pain of destruction.<br>
                On that occasion the fools<br>
                put me in the stocks,<br>
                One day I sang with the storm-<br>
                the wise men<br>
                sent me off to Ranchi.<br>
                Realizing that same day I myself would die<br>
                I stretched out on my bed.<br>
                A friend came along and pinched me hard<br>
                and said, Hey, madman,<br>
                your flesh isn't dead yet!<br>
                For years these things went on.<br>
                I'm crazy, friend-<br>
                that's just the way I am.</p>

                <p><strong>5.</strong><br>
                I called the Navab's wine blood,<br>
                the painted whore a corpse,<br>
                and the king a pauper.<br>
                I attacked Alexander with insults,<br>
                and denounced the so-called great souls.<br>
                The lowly I have raised on the bridge of praise<br>
                to the seventh heaven.<br>
                Your learned pandit is my great fool,<br>
                your heaven my hell,<br>
                your gold my iron,<br>
                friend! Your piety my sin.<br>
                Where you see yourself as brilliant<br>
                I find you a dolt.<br>
                Your rise, friend-my decline.<br>
                That's the way our values are mixed up,<br>
                friend!<br>
                Your whole world is a hair to me.<br>
                Oh yes, friend, I'm moonstruck through and through-<br>
                moonstruck!<br>
                That's just the way I am.</p>

                <p><strong>6.</strong><br>
                I see the blind man as the people's guide,<br>
                the ascetic in his cave a deserter;<br>
                those who act in the theater of lies<br>
                I see as dark buffoons.<br>
                Those who fail I find successful,<br>
                and progress only backsliding.<br>
                am I squint-eyed,<br>
                Or just crazy?<br>
                Friend, I'm crazy.<br>
                Look at the withered tongues of shameless leaders,<br>
                The dance of the whores<br>
                At breaking the backbone on the people's rights.<br>
                When the sparrow-headed newsprint spreads its black lies<br>
                In a web of falsehood<br>
                To challenge Reason-the hero in myself-<br>
                My cheeks turn red, friend,<br>
                red as molten coal.<br>
                When simple people drink dark poison with their ears<br>
                Thinking it nectar-<br>
                and right before my eyes, friend!-<br>
                then every hair on my body stands up stiff<br>
                as the Gorgon's serpent hair-<br>
                every hair on me maddened!<br>
                When I see the tiger daring to eat the deer, friend,<br>
                or the big fish the little,<br>
                then into my rotten bones there comes<br>
                the terrible strength of the soul of Dadhichi<br>
                and tries to speak, friend,<br>
                like the stormy day crashing down from heaven with the lightning.<br>
                When man regards a man<br>
                as not a man, friend,<br>
                then my teeth grind together, all thirty-two,<br>
                top and bottom jaws,<br>
                like the teeth if Bhimasena.<br>
                And then<br>
                red with rage my eyeballs rool<br>
                round and round, with one sweep<br>
                like a lashing flame<br>
                taking in this inhuman human world.<br>
                My organs leap out of theirs frames-<br>
                uproar! Uproar!<br>
                my breathing becomes a storm,<br>
                my face distorted, my brain on fire, friend!<br>
                with a fire like those that burn beneath the sea,<br>
                like the fire that devours the forests,<br>
                frenzied, friend!<br>
                as one who would swallow the wide world raw.<br>
                Oh yes, my friend,<br>
                the beautiful chakora am I,<br>
                destroyer of the ugly,<br>
                both tender and cruel,<br>
                the bird that steals the heaven's fire,<br>
                child of the tempest,<br>
                spew of the insane volcano,<br>
                terror incarnate.<br>
                Oh yes, friend,<br>
                my brain is whirling, whirling-<br>
                that's just the way I am.</p>
