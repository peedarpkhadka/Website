            <h2>Number Systems and Conversions</h2>
            <h3>What is Number system?</h3>
            <p>
                In computing and digital electronics, numbers systems play a vital role in how data is represented and processed.
                the four most common number systems are <em>decimal (base 10), binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16) </em>.
                Each system has its own unique characteristics and applications.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Number Systems</h3>
            <p>Number systems are a way of representing numbers using a specific base or radix. The most common number systems are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decimal (Base 10)</li>
                <li>Binary (Base 2)</li>
                <li>Octal (Base 8)</li>
                <li>Hexadecimal (Base 16)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Decimal Number System:</h3> 
            <p>
                This is the number system most people use in daily life, composed of digits from 0 to 9.
                every digit has a palce based on power of 10. 
                For example, the number 345 in decimal is calculated as 3*10^2 + 4*10^1 + 5*10^0.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Binary Number System:</h3>
            <p>
                This system uses only two digits (0 and 1).
                Binary number system is fundamental in compuitng because digital circuts have two states: ON (1) and OFF (0).
                For example, the binary number 1011 is calculated as 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 in decimal.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Octal Number System:</h3>
            <p>
                The octal system uses digit form 0 to 7.
                It is often use in computing as a shorthand for binary, as each otcal digit represents three binary digits.
                For example, the octal number 17 is calculated as 1*8^1 + 7*8^0 = 8 + 7 = 15 in decimal.
            </P>
            
            <h3>Hexadecimal Number System:</h3>
            <p>
                The hexadecimal system uses digits form 0 to 9 and letters A to F, where A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, and F=15.
                It is commonly used in computing as a more compact representation of binary data. It is often used in programming and memory addressing. Hexadecimal numbers are calculated as follows:
                For example, the hexadecimal number 2F is calculated as 2*16^1 + 15*16^0 = 32 + 15 = 47 in decimal.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Conversions of one number system to another number system:</h3>
            <p>
                understanding how to convert between these systems is essential. For example:
                - To convert from decimal to binary, repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and record the remainders.
                - To convert from binary to decimal, multiply each binary digit by its corresponding power of 2 and sum the results.
                - To convert from decimal to octal, repeatedly divide the decimal number by 8 and record the remainders.
                - To convert from octal to decimal, multiply each octal digit by its corresponding power of 8 and sum the results.
                - To convert from decimal to hexadecimal, repeatedly divide the decimal number by 16 and record the remainders.
            </P>

            <ul>
                <li>Decimal to Binar: Divide the number by 2 and track the remainders.</li>
                <li>Binary to Decimal: Multiply each binary digit by its corresponding power of 2.
                    Binary 111011 = decimal 59
                </li>
                <li>Decimal to Octal: Divide the number by 8 and track the remainders.
                    Decimal 59 = octal 73
                </li>
                <li>Octal to Decimal: Multiply each octal digit by its corresponding power of 8.
                    Octal 73 = decimal 59
                </li>
                <li>Decimal to Hexadecimal: Divide the number by 16 and track the remainders.
                    Decimal 59 = hexadecimal 3B
                </li>
                <li>Hexadecimal to Decimal: Multiply each hexadecimal digit by its corresponding power of 16.
                    Hexadecimal 3B = decimal 59
                </li>
                <li>Binary to Octal: Group binary digits into sets of three and convert each group to its octal equivalent.
                    Binary 111011 = octal 73
                </li>
                <li>Octal to Binary: Convert each octal digit to its three-digit binary equivalent.
                    Octal 73 = binary 111011
                </li>
                <li>Binary to Hexadecimal: Group binary digits into sets of four and convert each group to its hexadecimal equivalent.
                    Binary 111011 = hexadecimal 3B
                </li>
                <li>Hexadecimal to Binary: Convert each hexadecimal digit to its four-digit binary equivalent.
                    Hexadecimal 3B = binary 00111011
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Two's Complement?</h3> 
            <p>
                This is a method of representing negative numbers in binary.
                It is simplifies the design of arithmetic circuits. To find the two's complement of a binary number, invert all bits and add 1 to the least significant bit (LSB).
                For example, the two's complement of 0101 (5 in decimal) is 1011 (-5 in decimal).
            </p>
            
            <h3>Applications of Number in different secotrs:</h3>
            <p>
                Number systems are used in IP addressing, memory allocation, error detection, encryption, and data compression.
                Programmers often rely on hexadecimal values for debugging and binary logic for algorithms.
                Understanding these systems is crucial for computer science and digital electronics.
                The ability to convert between these systems is essential for tasks such as data representation, memory management, and network communication.
                Mastering number systems and conversions is fundamental for anyone working in computing, programming, or digital electronics.
                By grasping these concepts, you can enhance your problem-solving skills and gain a deeper understanding of how computers process information.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Real-World examples of Number systems:</h3>
            <p>
                Consider a computer storing the letter 'A'. It uses ASCII code, which in biray is 01000001.
                This representation is fundamental to how all data-text, images, and video are stored and manipulated.
                Understanding number systems and conversions is essential for anyone working in computing, programming, or digital electronics.
